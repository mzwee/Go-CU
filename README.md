# Go-CU
## Introduction
Go-CU is a project for Pebble smartwatch started at HackIllinois 2015. The main aim of the Go-CU project is to provide information to the user on the nearest bus stop to them, the next bus that comes to the bus stop and how many more minutes it will leave in. Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (cumtd) API is used in this project to provide bus information.

## Future Plans
1. Expand coverage of the project to other states in U.S.
2. Allow users to select preferred bus route.
